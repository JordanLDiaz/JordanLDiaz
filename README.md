### Hi there 👋
My name is Jordan Diaz and I am currently a student at Boise Codeworks, training to be a full stack developer. I have a bachelors in psychology and sociology, as well as a masters in elementary education, and have experience teaching in education as an elementary teacher. Making the jump to the world of software and web development has been an incredible journey so far, and I am excited to continue learning and growing in this ever-changing field. I have a strong interest in front end-development and UI/UX, but have also enjoyed the challenges that come with working with databases on the back-end. Watching an application come to life through the completion of both the front and back end with my own two hands is an amazing feeling!

- 🌱 I’m currently honing my skills in HTML, CSS/BOOTSTRAP, MVC DESIGN PATTERNS, JAVASCRIPT, VUE.JS, NODE.JS, C#/.NET, MONGO DB/MONGOOSE, MY SQL, SASS.
- 🔭 In the future I would like to learn PYTHON, REACT, C++, RUBY, GO, AND MORE!
